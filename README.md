## üõ†Ô∏è Performance Monitoring

### Built-in Performance Monitor

Run the performance monitoring script:
```bash
python monitor_performance.py
```

This provides:
- Real-time CPU usage monitoring
- NIDPS process resource tracking
- Performance recommendations
- System health indicators

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Low CPU Usage**: Keep performance mode ON, sampling rates low (5-10%)
2. **More Detailed Data**: Increase sampling rates in Configuration ‚Üí Performance Settings
3. **Full Logging**: Enable "Log All Packets" for detailed packet analysis
4. **Monitor Resources**: Use the performance script to track system impact

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High CPU Usage**: 
   - Enable Performance Mode in Configuration
   - Reduce packet sampling rates
   - Disable packet logging if not needed
   - Use the performance monitor script

2. **Permission Denied for Packet Sniffing**: 
   - Grant capabilities: `sudo setcap cap_net_raw=eip $(which python3)`
   - Or run with sudo: `sudo python run.py`
   - Some detection features may be limited without privileges

3. **UFW Not Available**:
   - Install UFW: `sudo apt-get install ufw`
   - Enable UFW: `sudo ufw enable`

4. **Import Errors**: 
   - Ensure the virtual environment is activated
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

5. **Database Errors**: 
   - Run the database initialization commands
   - Check file permissions for the database file

### Logs and Monitoring

- **Application Logs**: `logs/nidps.log`
- **System Logs**: Available through the web interface
- **Performance Logs**: Real-time monitoring via web interface
- **UFW Logs**: `sudo ufw status verbose`

## üîí Security Considerations

- The application runs as a normal user for security
- UFW integration provides firewall protection
- Role-based access control restricts administrative functions
- All sensitive operations are logged with audit trails
- IP blocking has automatic expiration to prevent permanent blocks
- Performance optimizations maintain security while reducing resource usage
- Auto-recovery system ensures continuous operation
